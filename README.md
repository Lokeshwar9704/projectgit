# Jenkins Pipeline Setup

This README describes the configuration settings for a Jenkins pipeline to ensure continuous integration (CI) for a project hosted on GitLab or GitHub. This pipeline is designed to validate build stability and monitor changes in the source repository.This pipeline is configured to automatically trigger builds based on changes in a GitLab or GitHub repository. It provides options to handle concurrency, manage credentials, and specify build triggers. Additionally, the pipeline setup allows for speed/durability optimization and stash preservation between builds.
